# Engineering Log - Day 4

**Date:** November 27, 2025

## Git Learnings
- Git is a **distributed version control system** that tracks changes in code.
- Key commands mastered: `git add`, `git commit`, `git push`, `git status`.
- **Contribution graph** shows daily activity streaks - crucial for discipline.
- Branching and merging enable parallel development without conflicts.

## Optical Engineering Insights
- **Optical engineering** designs systems using light (lasers, lenses, fibers).
- Core concepts: refraction, diffraction, polarization, beam propagation.
- Applications in data engineering: fiber optics for high-speed data transfer, laser alignment in manufacturing.
- Linked to modern data centers - optical interconnects reduce latency.

**Next Steps:** Apply Git workflow to dbt + Snowflake projects.
